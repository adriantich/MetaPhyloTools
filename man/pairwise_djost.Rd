\title{Calculate Pairwise Jost's D Differentiation}
\usage{
pairwise_djost(
  df,
  sample_names,
  sample_groups = NULL,
  motu_col = "MOTU",
  rarefy = TRUE,
  rarefy_to = min
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing MOTU abundance data}

\item{sample_names}{Vector of column names representing samples}

\item{sample_groups}{Optional vector of group assignments for samples. 
Must be the same length as sample_names and in the same order.
If NULL, each sample is treated as its own group}

\item{motu_col}{Name of the column containing MOTU identifiers (default: "MOTU")}

\item{rarefy}{Logical, whether to rarefy data within MOTU (default: TRUE)}

\item{rarefy_to}{Function to determine rarefaction depth (default: min)}
}
\value{
A list containing Jost's D matrices for each MOTU, and optionally 
  grouped results if sample_groups is provided
}
\description{
Calculates pairwise Jost's D differentiation indices between samples, 
optionally grouped by sample groups and per MOTU (Molecular Operational 
Taxonomic Unit).
}
\details{
Jost's D is a measure of differentiation that is independent of 
  within-population diversity. This function calculates it for each MOTU 
  separately and can group samples for analysis. The function rarefies data
  within each MOTU to standardize sampling effort before calculating 
  Jost's D this rarefaction uses the funcion vegan::rrarefy and 
  the specified rarefaction depth defined by the user with the parameter
  rarefy_to (default is the minimum sample sum across samples with non-zero
  counts within each MOTU).
}
\examples{
# Example with mock data
df <- data.frame(
  MOTU = rep(c("MOTU1", "MOTU2"), each = 5),
  sample1 = rpois(10, 5), 
  sample2 = rpois(10, 3),
  sample3 = rpois(10, 4)
)
result <- pairwise_djost(df, c("sample1", "sample2", "sample3"))
