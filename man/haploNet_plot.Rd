\title{Plot haplotype network with pie charts}
\usage{
haploNet_plot(haploNet_data_object, output_file, bg, plot_title)
}
\arguments{
\item{haploNet_data_object}{A list object returned by \code{haploNet_data()} containing
network and pie chart data. Must include elements:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{network}}{A haplotype network object from \code{pegas::haploNet()}}
  \item{\code{pieseas}}{A matrix with pie chart data for each haplotype}}}

\item{output_file}{Character string. File path for the output PDF plot (e.g., "network_plot.pdf").}

\item{bg}{A vector of colors for the pie chart segments. Length should match the number
of groups in the pie chart data. Used for both pie segments and legend.}

\item{plot_title}{Character string. Main title to be displayed at the top of the plot.}
}
\value{
No return value. The function creates a PDF file at the specified location.
}
\description{
This function creates a publication-ready haplotype network plot with pie charts
showing the relative abundance or frequency of haplotypes across different groups.
The plot includes a legend and title, and is saved as a PDF file.
}
\details{
The function creates a multi-panel plot with:
\itemize{
  \item Main haplotype network with pie charts at each node
  \item Node sizes proportional to haplotype frequencies
  \item Title at the top of the plot
  \item Legend at the bottom showing group categories (currently hardcoded as "Inside"/"Outside")
}

Plot specifications:
\itemize{
  \item PDF dimensions: 15 x 15 inches
  \item High-resolution output suitable for publication
  \item Customizable colors and title
  \item Error handling for plot generation issues
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
  \item Requires the \code{pegas} package for network plotting
  \item Legend labels are currently hardcoded as "Inside" and "Outside"
  \item The function assumes a two-group comparison (modify legend for more groups)
  \item If plotting fails, an error message is displayed with details
}
